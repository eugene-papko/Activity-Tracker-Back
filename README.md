Welcome to Practice Tracker

The idea behind this project is to build a mobile app that communicates with Amazon Dash Buttons, tracks every time the particular button is pressed and records information to the database. User tracks start and end times for certain activities: practicing their hobby, jogging, walking with dog, vacuuming, etc. App will show various reports on how much time user spent doing specific activity in a particular period of time (day, week, month, etc.) User can also set a goal for certain activities and track the progress in archiving the goal.
